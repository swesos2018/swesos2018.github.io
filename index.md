# Third Swedish Workshop on the Engineering of Systems-of-Systems
## Linköping, November 22 2018

## Purpose

Systems-of-systems (SoS) is a topic of increasing importance as the digitalization of society accelerates. An SoS refers to a situation where a number of independent systems collaborate to create a value that they cannot achieve individually. 

The Swedish Workshop on the Engineering of Systems-of-Systems (SWESoS) has the primary purpose of creating a meeting place for researchers and practitioners interested in systems-of-systems. The workshop is an informal event, focusing on presentation of results and ongoing research, to stimulate interaction among the researchers. Following two successful events in Stockholm (2015) and Göteborg (2016), the third workshop in the series will be held in Linköping.

## Topics of interest

The scope of the workshop is all aspects related to systems of systems engineering. This includes, but is not restricted to, the following topics when applied to systems-of-systems:

- Autonomous and cooperative systems
- Business models, including software ecosystems
- Case studies of applications in different domains
- Control strategies
- Communication
- Dependability, robustness, and other quality attributes
- Enterprise architecture
- Governance
- Interoperability
- Modeling and simulation, including multi-agent systems
- Service oriented architecture
- Systems engineering methods
- Systems thinking


## Participation and venue

The workshop will take place at the Department of Computer Science, Linköping University, in room [Alan Turing](https://www.ida.liu.se/department/location/search.sv.shtml?keyword=alan+turing).

Participation is free of charge, except that participants may have to pay their own lunch. All participants (including presenters) need to register for the workshop.

## Submission guidelines

Researchers interested in presenting at the conference should submit an extended abstract (500-1000 words) in English prior to the submission deadline. 

The selection process will be inclusive, i.e., all serious submissions that are reasonably within the scope of the workshop, and that meet normal academic quality standards, will be accepted. There are no requirements on uniqueness, so it is possible to reuse material that has already been presented elsewhere. 

The extended abstracts will be put into a proceedings document. Each author will be given a presentation slot of approximately 20 min. The conference language is English.

Important dates (all dates are firm, no extensions will be given):

- Oct. 19: Submission of extended abstract.
- Oct. 26: Notification of acceptance.
- Nov. 9: Final version of extended abstracts for inclusion in proceedings.
- Nov. 22: Workshop.

## Program

The final program will be published end of October. It will consist of a few keynote presentations, participant presentations, and discussions. The preliminary duration is 9.00-16.00.

## Proceedings

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/swesos2018/swesos2018.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
