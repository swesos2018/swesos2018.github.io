## Purpose

Systems-of-systems (SoS) is a topic of increasing importance as the digitalization of society accelerates. An SoS refers to a situation where a number of independent systems collaborate to create a value that they cannot achieve individually. 

The Swedish Workshop on the Engineering of Systems-of-Systems (SWESoS) has the primary purpose of creating a meeting place for researchers and practitioners interested in systems-of-systems. The workshop is an informal event, focusing on presentation of results and ongoing research, to stimulate interaction among the researchers. Following two successful events in [Stockholm (2015)](https://www.sics.se/events/1st-scandinavian-workshop-on-the-engineering-of-systems-of-systems-swesos-2015) and [Göteborg (2016)](http://swesos2016.github.io/), the third workshop in the series will be held in Linköping on November 22, 2018.

## Topics of interest

The scope of the workshop is all aspects related to systems-of-systems engineering. This includes, but is not restricted to, the following topics **when applied to systems-of-systems**:

- Architecture
- Autonomous and cooperative systems
- Business models, including software ecosystems
- Case studies of applications in different domains
- Control strategies
- Communication
- Dependability, robustness, and other quality attributes
- Enterprise architecture
- Governance
- Interoperability
- Modeling and simulation, including multi-agent systems
- Service oriented architecture
- Systems engineering methods
- Systems thinking


## Participation and venue

The workshop will take place at the Department of Computer Science, Linköping University, in room [Alan Turing](https://www.ida.liu.se/department/location/search.sv.shtml?keyword=alan+turing).

Participation is free of charge, except that participants may have to pay their own lunch. All participants (including presenters) need to [register](https://simplesignup.se/event/138267) for the workshop.

If you have any dietary restrictions, please contact the organizers.

## Submission guidelines

Researchers interested in presenting at the conference should submit an extended abstract (500-1000 words) in English prior to the submission deadline. The proceedings will use [IEEE template](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html), so we highly recommend to apply this formatting already in the first submission. Papers should be submitted using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swesos2018).

The selection of contributions will be based on:

- Relevance to the workshop, i.e. how closely related to systems-of-systems engineering the submission is; 
- Interest to participants from a practical or theoretical perspective, i.e. including applicability, novelty, etc.; and 
- Quality of the presentation.

Note that there are no requirements on uniqueness, so it is possible to reuse or extend material that has already been presented elsewhere but that may not be known to a Swedish audience.

Each paper will be given a presentation slot of approximately 20 min. The conference language is English.

Important dates (all dates are firm, no extensions will be given):

- Oct. 19: Submission of extended abstract.
- Oct. 26: Notification of acceptance.
- Nov. 9: Final version of extended abstracts for inclusion in proceedings.
- Nov. 15: Final date for registrations.
- Nov. 22: Workshop.

## Program

The final program will be published end of October. It will consist of a few keynote presentations, participant presentations, and discussions. The preliminary duration is 9.00-17.00.

## Proceedings and presentations

The extended abstracts will be put into a proceedings document and published as a technical report. The presentations will be posted on this page.

## Organizers

General chair: Jakob Axelsson, RISE and Mälardalen University (jakob.axelsson (a) ri.se).

Organizing committee: To be added.
